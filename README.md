Title of the Project: Alien Invasion


Project Overview: 

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship right to left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship(life). If the player loses three ships, the game ends. For the first phase of development, we’ll make a ship that can move right and left. The ship should be able to fire bullets when the player presses the spacebar. After setting up this behaviour, we can turn our attention to the aliens and refine the gameplay.

Features:

-- ship's life being represented with the ship's photo at the top left

-- Game becomes more challenging as the user clears any fleet of aliens from the screen

-- Press the play button with the mouse to start the game

-- Adjust the bullet's width in the settings module to have the bomb feature

-- Compare the current score and the previous, it the current is the highest, let it be our new high score.


Technologies Used:

---- Python as the main language
---- Pygame packages and drivers
---- Github for code hosting
---- Trello and lucid chard for architecture representation
---- LinkedID for project's blog post
---- Google Slide for project's presentation


Installation:

- To play the game, one needs to have the following

---- python3 available on the user's computer (sudo apt-get -y install python3)
---- pygame available on the user's computer (sudo apt-get -y install pygame)

These are the technologies the user needs in order to play the game successfully


Usage:

--- change directory to the repo where the project is located
--- run the alien_invasion.py module to play the game (python3 alien_invasion.py)
--- click the play button when the pygame window appears
--- press the space button to shoot bullets
--- use the left and right arrow button for ship navigation
